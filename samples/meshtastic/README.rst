Meshtastic sample app
#####################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates the Zephyr-native Meshtastic stack. It initializes the stack and then
registers a receive callback that logs incoming text messages and broadcasts a greeting at regular
interval on the default "LongFast" channel.

Requirements
************

* A board with a supported LoRa transceiver, available as ``lora0`` devicetree alias.
* The ``nanopb`` module must be present in the west workspace

The sample has been tested with the following boards:

- Arduino GIGA R1 with a Semtech SX1262 shield
- LilyGO T-Watch Ultra with a Semtech SX1262 shield
- Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) (ESP32-S3, on-board Semtech SX1262)

Building and Running
********************

By default the node ID is derived from the hardware device ID (using HWINFO driver). To use a fixed
ID instead, enable custom source and set the default:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b <your_board> samples/meshtastic -- \
     -DCONFIG_MESHTASTIC_NODE_ID_CUSTOM=y \
     -DCONFIG_MESHTASTIC_NODE_ID_DEFAULT=0x01020304

The sample can also be built for the LoRa radio emulator on ``native_sim``
by adding the appropriate overlay.

Shell commands (TBC)
********************

When ``CONFIG_MESHTASTIC_SHELL=y``), the following shell commands are available:

* ``meshtastic status`` — node counters, primary channel hash, device role, rebroadcast mode
* ``meshtastic channel list`` / ``channel show <0-7>`` — channel table
* ``meshtastic channel set <index> name <str> role secondary psk default`` — runtime channel edit (RAM only)
* ``meshtastic channel disable <index>`` — disable a slot
* ``meshtastic device role [client|router|...]`` — mesh device role
* ``meshtastic device rebroadcast [all|none|local_only|...]`` — relay policy
* ``meshtastic text send [-c <index>] [dest|broadcast] <message>`` — send on a specific channel

More commands are available when additional features (e.g. environment metrics, GNSS, ...) are
enabled, e.g.:

* ``meshtastic nodedb list`` — list NodeDB entries
* ``meshtastic nodedb show <node|0xnode>`` — show one NodeDB entry
* ``meshtastic metrics send [-c <index>] [dest|broadcast]`` — send device metrics
* ``meshtastic environment send [-c <index>] [dest|broadcast]`` — send environment telemetry
* ``meshtastic nodeinfo send [-c <index>] [dest|broadcast]`` — send node information
* ``meshtastic gnss send [-c <index>] [dest|broadcast]`` — send GNSS position
